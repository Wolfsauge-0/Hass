# This is a Hack

[!WARNING]
This is strongly opinionated code created for only one purpose. It has been written by somebody knowing jack shit about ansible and just trying to get stuff up and running

I do not claim:
- This code is pretty
- This code will work on any machine
- No, not even on my own
- This Code is without errors

If you are still interested, these are some ansible roles fudged together to install kvm, set up users, download the HAOS KVM image and make it run on a Debian Bookworkm. At the time of writing this, not even the master branch is working, because right now, I'm dead tired and I performed a git-and-run.

You have been warned. >:D
